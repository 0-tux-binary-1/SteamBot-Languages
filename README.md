## Translating:
To create a translation, just download one of the .json files in /languages and translate it. 

DO NOT TRANSLATE THE KEYS, for example: `"game": "Must wait another %t seconds before searching again (%cd second cooldown)"`

Translate `"Must wait another %t seconds before searching again (%cd second cooldown)"`, but don't translate `game`

any thing like `%t`, `%cd` or `%s` are where information will be added, don't get rid of these. Try and keep formatting the same please.
