To create a translation, just download one of the .json files in /languages and translate it. DO NOT TRANSLATE THE KEYS, for example 
    "game": "Must wait another %t seconds before searching again (%cd second cooldown)"
translate "Must wait another %t seconds before searching again (%cd second cooldown)"
DO NOT TRANSLATE "game"
any thing like %t, %cd or %s are where information will be added, don't get rid of these. Try and keep formatting the same please.
